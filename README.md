Cody's AI/ML Portfolio Projects – Healthcare & Biomedical Focus

Hi, I'm Cody! Welcome to my portfolio of AI/ML projects, where I explore real-world problems across healthcare, clinical diagnostics, and biomedical data. Each project demonstrates a core skillset in data science, including exploratory analysis, supervised learning, deep learning, GenAI applications, and domain-specific modeling.
